## Corpus consultation

| Tool | Description | Target languages | Owners | Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CorpusMate](https://corpusmate.com/) | CorpusMate aims to provide a streamlined, simplified language data analysis experience for (younger) learners of English. The most distinctive feature of the tool is that it collapses the keyword-in-context (KWIC) results into one single line per pattern, which considerably increases the "digestibility" of the corpus query. For more details, we refer to the corresponding [paper](https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ijcl.23056.cro). | English | Peter Crosthwaite (University of Queensland) and VÃ­t Baisa | Free |
| [SCAP](https://scap.ugent.be) | The "Consultar" section of the SCAP (Spanish Corpus Annotation Project) platform allows users to (1) analyse how (sequences) of words are used in a series of Spanish corpora and (2) create word lists for these corpora. | Spanish | Patrick Goethals (Ghent University) | Free* |
| [SKELL](https://www.sketchengine.eu/skell/) | SKELL (SKetch Engine for Language Learning) enables language students and teachers to check the usage, collocations, and synonyms of a particular phrase or a word is used in authentic data. All examples, collocations, and synonyms were identified automatically by computational algorithms and state-of-the-art software analysing large multi-billion samples of text. | Czech, English, Estonian, German, Italian, Russian | Sketch Engine | Free |

## Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)

| Tool | Description | Target languages | Owner | Access | Recommendation |

| [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/overview/) | ChatGPT is an AI model that uses deep learning to generate human-like text based on so-called "prompts". It works by predicting the next word in a given text, based on the patterns it has learned from a massive amount of data during its training process. Apart from generating text, it is also able to generate programming code and create images. For a more elaborate description, we refer to the [OpenAI article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-what-is-chatgpt) on ChatGPT. | For the full list of languages, we refer to the corresponding [OpenAI article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8357869-how-to-change-your-language-setting-in-chatgpt). | OpenAI | Free** | ChatGPT can be used as an "idea provider", writing **assistant**, programming companion, or analyst. Using ChatGPT as a search engine or translator should be done with caution, as the tool is not specifically designed to stick to factual information (i.e. it can "hallucinate"). Importantly, Ghent University recommends Microsoft Copilot as the go-to GenAI tool, since data protection is - unlike with ChatGPT - guaranteed thanks to an agreement with Microsoft. |

## Language learning

| Tool | Description | Target languages | Owner | Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [SCAP](https://scap.ugent.be) | The "Aprender" section of the SCAP (Spanish Corpus Annotation Project) platform allows users to create (1) vocabulary lists with translations and/or example sentences and (2) fill-in-the-blanks exercises. The corpus examples included in the resources and exercises have been specifically selected based on their pedagogical suitability. | Spanish | Patrick Goethals (Ghent University) | Free* |
