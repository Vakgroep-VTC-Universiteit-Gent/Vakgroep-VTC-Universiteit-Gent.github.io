*Last update: 12 June 2025*

For all those who sometimes thought to themselves "AI AI AI*, I'm starting to lose track of all these technological advances in the field of language learning": this page is for you. On this website, you will find an overview of the available technology-driven tools and resources that are being/can be used for language learning and/or teaching purposes. The overview is updated regularly, but should you come across an interesting tool/resource yourself, do not hesitate to share your discovery by sending an email to the address included at the bottom of this page.

This website is developed and maintained by the Ghent University Department of Translation, Interpreting and Communication (Vakgroep Vertalen, Tolken en Communicatie or "VTC" in short). Although the web space is primarily aimed at students and teachers affiliated with the VTC department, much of the information provided should also be useful for anyone in- or outside of academia who is involved in language learning/teaching. Should you have a question to which the website does not provide a (satisfactory) answer, feel free to contact us at the email address below.

**Disclaimer 1**: None of the pieces of content on this website have been written by means of generative artificial intelligence, so please take into account that all information provided is one hundred percent authentic, sincere, and truthful. No additional checks should be performed on the factual information being presented. For any errors still remaining in the text (such as the occasional spelling mistake), we take full responsibility but plead not guilty on all charges, with *errare humanum est* as the judicial ground.

**Disclaimer 2**: This website is *not* the official web space of the VTC department. In case you are looking for more information regarding the department or applied linguistics study career, please visit VTC's [main website](https://www.ugent.be/lw/vtc/nl).

\* Pun intended!
